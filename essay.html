			  <h1>Haunting Shifts: A Day in the Life of a Horror Location Scout in NY/NJ</h1>

			  <indent><p>It starts with a vague text from the director: “Need something that feels wrong but familiar. Bonus if it’s near transit.” It’s 6:43 a.m. and I’m in my Brooklyn apartment, half awake and already digging through past location notes, Google Earth pins, and the leftover remains of last night’s diner coffee. This isn’t my first horror shoot but every project brings a different flavor of fear. Today’s goal? Find three potential locations across New York and New Jersey for an upcoming indie horror film about “a suburban haunting that starts slow but rises to infectious rates once it hits the city.”</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>This visual essay documents a day in the life of a horror location scout, tracing the strange beauty and unsettling potential of urban chaos, suburban stillness, and rural decay. As part of a site dedicated to horror’s roots in New York and New Jersey, this page offers a process-oriented, behind-the-scenes look at how horror films don’t just happen in spooky houses or obvious landmarks. These are built through careful attention to place, texture, and contradiction.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>Over the next 12 hours, I crisscross rivers, boroughs, highways, and dead-end streets. You’ll follow along—through images and notes as I uncover horror in familiar spaces, reframe overlooked corners, and capture what it means to see local geography through a haunted lens. You might never walk through your own neighborhood the same way again.</p></indent>

			  <center><h2>Urban Encounters — Blood in the Gutter, Glamour on the Edge</h2></center>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve9.jpg" alt="Late night light hitting an abandoned stairwell"></center>

			  <indent><p>I start in the Lower East Side dusk creeping in through alleyways and metal gates. Cities are loud and alive, but also lonely. Horror set in NYC thrives on this paradox. Think Basket Case or American Psycho: characters melt into crowds, but no one really sees them.</p></indent>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve8.jpg" alt="Rooftop view of downtown"></center>

			  <indent><p>The director wanted “verticality,” something oppressive but poetic. Rooftops are perfect for this: they suggest danger, desperation, movement between states of safety and peril.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>Urban horror doesn’t need a ghost. It just needs too many people, no space to breathe, and the creeping sense that you’re being watched even in public. These streets hum with stories, and if I’ve done my job right, the terror won’t feel imported—it’ll feel inevitable.</p></indent>

			  <br>
			  <center><h2>Suburban Shadows — Where Nothing Bad Ever Happens… Until It Does</h2></center>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve1.jpg" alt="Identical houses around"></center>

			  <indent><p>By late into the night, I’m across the Hudson in suburban New Jersey—Rutherford, then Clifton, then a quick stop in Verona. Every house looks safe and predictable. That’s what makes it terrifying. Horror in the suburbs is about rupture; you expect stability, and the smallest disruption feels seismic.</p></indent>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve3.jpg" alt="A cul-de-sac dead end"></center>

			  <indent><p>This is an intentional design of the engineer who built this dead end road. But to my lens, it looks ominous. Films like The Amityville Horror and Don’t Go in the House mine terror from this exact tension: nothing obviously wrong, but something’s off.</p></indent>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve4.jpg" alt="An empty playground"></center>

			  <indent><p>The suburban uncanny often hides in cliche places like parking lots, gas stations, and empty playgrounds. These liminal spaces let horror breathe in the gaps. You start to wonder: is the danger inside the house… or has the whole neighborhood always been haunted?</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>Suburbia offers control. Horror takes that control and chips away at it, bit by bit.</p></indent>

			  <br>
			  <center><h2>Rural Ruins & Remote Nightfall — Isolation Breeds Imagination</h2></center>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve7.jpg" alt="Vines climbing a side of the building"></center>

			  <indent><p>Past midnight. I drive north toward the forested edges of New Jersey. Cell signal weakens. My GPS cuts out. I follow a paper map to reach an old property I scouted two years ago. It's more overgrown now, but perfect. Isolation invites imagination. You fill silence with suspicion.</p></indent>

			  <center><img src="finalImgs/ve6.jpg" alt="A gravel trail leading into woods"></center>

			  <indent><p>The director wants “the final confrontation” here. I test a few angles—long shots with no center subject. Something watching. Something absent. In horror, empty spaces matter as much as what’s in frame.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>I set up one last shot with the trees closing in. Later, when I edit the photo, I’ll see something odd in the background. A smudge? Or a figure?</p></indent>

			  <br>
			  <center><h2>My Final Message</h2></center>

			  <indent><p>Back in Brooklyn. It’s nearly 6 in the morning. My camera’s memory card is full, and my laptop hums as it transfers image files. I scroll through thumbnails: city grime, suburban geometry, rural rot. Then I see the last photo of the trees.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>In the shadows near the tree line, something blurs the edge. It could be a trick of the light. Or not. I zoom in, but the resolution breaks. My pulse flickers.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>This is the heart of horror: it asks us to look again. And again. And to never be certain. Through this night’s journey, I’ve captured more than just places, I’ve caught impressions, suspicions, atmospheres. A stairwell becomes a descent into madness. A front lawn becomes a battleground. A forest becomes the unknowable.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>If you’ve followed me this far, maybe you’ve started to see it too. Horror isn’t just in the stories we tell, it’s in how we see the spaces around us. This visual essay adds dimension to the larger project of this site by grounding horror in the textures of New York and New Jersey, not just as settings, but as active agents in storytelling.</p></indent>

			  <indent><p>Tomorrow’s locations? Who knows. But one thing’s certain: I’ll keep looking for that moment when a place stops being ordinary and starts becoming a story.</p></indent>
